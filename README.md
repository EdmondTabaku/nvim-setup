# Edmond's Lazyvim

I took this configurations from [viis-lazyvim](https://github.com/JackDerksen/viis-lazyvim) and added some plugins and keymaps that I like.

For a perfect zen experience I use the following setup:
- Terminal with 0.9 opacity, acrylic material and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
- The zenmode.ps1 and zenmode.bat scripts which centers the terminal window. You can add the bat file in your path for simplicity
- This perfect [Berserk wallpaper](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/347/278/large/anato-finnstark-anato-finnstark-the-band-of-the-hawk-berserk-by-anatofinnstark-dct5yif-fullview.jpg?1559045840) by [Anato Finnstark](https://www.artstation.com/anto-finnstark)
